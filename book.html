							                                        We all deserve to have access to basic knowledge of healing practices without having to complete a course at an institution. This workshop will teach you the basics of massage safety and technique, some basic anatomy, and how to massage from your own home without any special equipment.<br><br>
							                                        This workshop is meant for 2 people. Perfect for those wanting to care for their parents; couples; or friends who enjoy massaging. I will provide all sheets, oils, and tools needed. You only need to bring yourselves.<br><br>
							                                        I will perform demos on both people, so in addition to learning, you will also receive bodywork (which is essential to learning!)<br><br>
							                                        The cost of this workshop is $250. Payment instructions will be sent via email.<br><br>

							                                        I will use an energy work modality known as reiki, which is an energetic massage that does not involve the same degree of touch as a regular massage. You can learn more about my reiki training and background on my “about me” page. Using universal life force from nature, I will channel energy to energetically imbalanced areas of your body to aid in emotional and physical healing.<br><br>
							                                        This is an excellent option for anyone who is unable to receive touch for whatever reason; feeling disconnected from their body or spirituality; feeling imbalanced; experiencing strong depression or anxiety; or just looking to explore different modalities of healing. One must be open to the healing potential of energy work before receiving it.<br><br>

							                                        Whether this is your first time getting bodywork or you are a seasoned bodywork receiver, the 60 minute sliding scale session is a great way to get comprehensive work done in a short amount of time. The format of this massage is a Swedish full-body massage (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and get circulation going) on the major body parts, combined with deeper pressure or deep tissue work in one area of the body that requires more attention. For example, many people opt to have work done on their neck or upper back, but it’s completely up to you. I would especially recommend this option to anyone who is just trying out bodywork and unsure of committing to a longer massage. 60 minutes is a great length to feel the full-body benefits of massage, whereas the 30 minute option is more for a specific body part that needs work.<br><br>
							                                        This massage is sliding scale with a recommended payment of $80 - $130 per session. <br><br>

							                                        This is my favorite length of time to work, as it really allows the body to fall into relaxation and integrate the work. I will start with a Swedish full-body massage (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and stimulate circulation) and focus in on up to 3 specific body parts that require attention using deeper pressure. If you are looking for significant tension relief in multiple areas, I would recommend this option.<br><br>

							                                        This is the longest session length I offer and it allows us to really take the time to sink in and address the body both comprehensively and thoroughly. My work is very slow and intentional, which allows for deeper pressure and thus deeper release. Like the other sliding scale options, I will start with a Swedish full-body massage (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and stimulate circulation), and will be able to spend extra time on small details and oft-neglected body parts. Then, as time allows, we can apply deep tissue work on several specific body parts that require attention. I usually incorporate some Thai massage and assisted stretching to keep the work dynamic throughout this longer session. I would not necessarily recommend this to first-time bodywork receivers; try a shorter session to make sure you feel comfortable on the table.<br><br>

							                                        This option is intended for those seeking relief in one particular area of the body – maybe you slept weird and can’t turn your head, or strained your shoulder while climbing. Other examples include the upper back, the lower back, calves, hands, neck, etc. For things that come in pairs like arms and feet, I am able to work both sides. I will start by warming the area with some Swedish techniques, then go in with deep tissue and / or trigger point release work. This option may not be as relaxing as the others, since there is less time to calm the nervous system. I am going for effective work over relaxing. However, if you are pressed for time or simply have a budget, this is a great option. <br><br>

							                                        We use our hands for everything, so they're naturally under a lot of strain if not taken care of. You may experience shooting pains in your wrists or hands. This is especially true for climbers, artists, musicians, and skilled workers. I will do detailed work on your forearms, biceps, triceps, deltoids, and hands to revitalize your arms and get you feeling brand new.<br><br>

Trauma and societally imposed feelings of shame around the pelvic region causes many of us to unconsciously tense this area perpetually. I will work the sides and front of your hips, as well as your glutes to get your pelvis feeling loose and free again.<br><br>
