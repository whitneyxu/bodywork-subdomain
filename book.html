                                                            We all deserve to have access to basic knowledge of healing practices without having to complete a course at an institution. This workshop will teach you the basics of massage safety and technique, some basic anatomy, and how to massage from your own home without any special equipment.<br><br>
                                                            This workshop is meant for 2 people. Perfect for those wanting to care for their parents; couples; or friends who enjoy massaging. I will provide all sheets, oils, and tools needed. You only need to bring yourselves.<br><br>
                                                            I will perform demos on both people, so in addition to learning, you will also receive bodywork (which is essential to learning!)<br><br>
                                                            The cost of this workshop is $260. Payment instructions will be sent via email.<br><br>
                                                            If you are interested in more in-depth education about massage therapy, I recommend <a href="https://mckinnonbtc.com/" target="_blank">McKinnon Body Therapy Center</a> for classes.<br><br>

                                                            Cupping is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine which utilizes vacuums to create suction and increase blood flow to areas of tension. Cupping is an excellent way to increase range of motion and reduce pain. It is suitable for most people, but certain cases such as active cancer, anemia, or severe chronic disease may pose some risks. Please read the booking page thoroughly to make sure this modality is safe for you.<br><br>
                                                            We will start with an intake to determine where the cups should be placed. While the cups are doing their work, I will perform reiki to aid in the energy flow inside your body.<br><br>
                                                            Bookings can be made up to 24 hours in advance and I will take payment after the session.<br><br>

                                                            Have you been feeling emotionally blocked, unable to speak your truth, disconnected from your creativity, or fearful of intimacy? It is likely that your chakras are not aligned properly. During this session, I will read your chakras and determine which energy centers are off-balance, then perform reiki to adjust the energies so that they are in harmony again. I will also add bodywork when it feels necessary, usually for about half the session. I will create a summary of your chakra reading and send you home with recommendations on how to continue maintaining a balanced internal energy system.<br><br>
                                                            This session is very helpful for those who are seeking deeper connection to their spirits and emotional bodies.<br><br>

You can learn more about my reiki training and background on my "about me" page. Using universal life force from nature, I will channel energy to energetically imbalanced areas of your body to aid in emotional and physical healing.<br><br>
                                                            This is an excellent option for anyone who is unable to receive touch for whatever reason; feeling disconnected from their body or spirituality; feeling imbalanced; experiencing strong depression or anxiety; or just looking to explore different modalities of healing. One must be open to the healing potential of energy work before receiving it.<br><br>

                                                            I will use an energy work modality known as reiki, which is an energetic massage that does not involve the same degree of touch as a regular massage. You can learn more about my reiki training and background on my "about me" page. Using universal life force from nature, I will channel energy to energetically imbalanced areas of your body to aid in emotional and physical healing.<br><br>
                                                            This is an excellent option for anyone who is unable to receive touch for whatever reason; feeling disconnected from their body or spirituality; feeling imbalanced; experiencing strong depression or anxiety; or just looking to explore different modalities of healing. One must be open to the healing potential of energy work before receiving it.<br><br>
                                                            Bookings can be made up to 24 hours in advance and I will collect payment after the session.<br><br>

I will focus in on 1 - 3 areas of the body that are requiring attention, such as the shoulders, back, legs, arms, etc, using a combination of Swedish, deep tissue, trigger point release, and myofascial release.

                                                            This is the longest session length I offer and it allows us to really take the time to sink in and address the body both comprehensively and thoroughly. My work is very slow and intentional, which allows for deeper pressure and thus deeper release. Like the other sliding scale options, I will start with a Swedish full-body massage (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and stimulate circulation), and will be able to spend extra time on small details and oft-neglected body parts. Then, as time allows, we can apply deep tissue work on several specific body parts that require attention. I usually incorporate some Thai massage and assisted stretching to keep the work dynamic throughout this longer session. I would not necessarily recommend this to first-time bodywork receivers; try a shorter session to make sure you feel comfortable on the table.<br><br>

Other examples include the upper back, the lower back, calves, hands, neck, etc. For things that come in pairs like arms and feet, I am able to work both sides. I will start by warming the area with some Swedish techniques, then go in with deep tissue and / or trigger point release work. This option may not be as relaxing as the others, since there is less time to calm the nervous system. I am going for effective work over relaxing. However, if you are pressed for time or simply have a budget, this is a great option. <br><br>

You may experience shooting pains in your wrists or hands. This is especially true for climbers, artists, musicians, and skilled workers. I will do detailed work on your forearms, biceps, triceps, deltoids, and hands to revitalize your arms and get you feeling brand new.<br><br>

Trauma and societally imposed feelings of shame around the pelvic region causes many of us to unconsciously tense this area perpetually. I will work the sides and front of your hips, as well as your glutes to get your pelvis feeling loose and free again.<br><br>

Our bodies are where we experience emotion and this session is intended to hold a somatic space to support the processing of those stored emotions in our session.

                                                        I may use a variety of techniques such as rocking and shaking, tapping and thudding, guided tensing and relaxing, and point work, along with other massage techniques such as deep tissue, trigger point release, stretching, thai massage, and swedish. I encourage releases in whatever form feels the most cathartic to your body. I may also use strokes to encourage the flow of these stored emotions. After, we will debrief and close out.<br><br>
