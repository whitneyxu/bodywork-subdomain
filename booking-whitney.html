							                                        We all deserve to have access to basic knowledge of healing practices without having to complete a course at an institution. This workshop will teach you the basics of massage safety and technique, some basic anatomy, and how to massage from your own home without any special equipment.<br><br>
							                                        This workshop is meant for 2 people. Perfect for those wanting to care for their parents; couples; or friends who enjoy massaging. I will provide all sheets, oils, and tools needed. You only need to bring yourselves.<br><br>
							                                        I will perform demos on both people, so in addition to learning, you will also receive bodywork (which is essential to learning!)<br><br>
							                                        The cost of this workshop is $260. Payment instructions will be sent via email.<br><br>

							                                       Whether this is your first time getting bodywork or you are a seasoned bodywork receiver, the 60 minute sliding scale session is a great way to get comprehensive work done in a short amount of time. I will focus in on 1 - 3 areas of the body that are requiring attention, such as the shoulders, back, legs, arms, etc, using a combination of Swedish, deep tissue, trigger point release, and myofascial release. I would especially recommend this option to anyone who is just trying out bodywork and unsure of committing to a longer massage. <br><br>

							                                       This is my favorite length of time to work, as it really allows the body to fall into relaxation and integrate the work. I will start with Swedish techniques (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and stimulate circulation) and focus in on 3 - 4 specific body parts that require attention using a combination of deep tissue, trigger point release, and myofascial release. If you are looking for significant tension relief in multiple areas, I would recommend this option. <br><br>

							                                        This is the longest session length I offer and it allows us to really take the time to sink in and address the body both comprehensively and thoroughly. My work is very slow and intentional, which allows for deeper pressure and thus deeper release. Like the other sliding scale options, I will start with a Swedish full-body massage (light - medium pressure to warm the tissue and stimulate circulation), and will be able to spend extra time on small details and oft-neglected body parts. Then, as time allows, we can apply deep tissue work on several specific body parts that require attention. I usually incorporate some Thai massage and assisted stretching to keep the work dynamic throughout this longer session. I would not necessarily recommend this to first-time bodywork receivers; try a shorter session to make sure you feel comfortable on the table.<br><br>

							                                        This option is intended for those seeking relief in one particular area of the body – maybe you slept weird and can’t turn your head, or strained your shoulder while climbing. Other examples include the upper back, the lower back, calves, hands, neck, etc. For things that come in pairs like arms and feet, I am able to work both sides. I will start by warming the area with some Swedish techniques, then go in with deep tissue and / or trigger point release work. This option may not be as relaxing as the others, since there is less time to calm the nervous system. I am going for effective work over relaxing. However, if you are pressed for time or simply have a budget, this is a great option. <br><br>

							                                        So many of us sit for most of the day, causing our hip flexors to be in a chronically contracted state, which can lead to pain while walking, standing, or laying down. Trauma and societally imposed feelings of shame around the pelvic region causes many of us to unconsciously tense this area perpetually. I will work the sides and front of your hips, as well as your glutes to get your pelvis feeling loose and free again.<br><br>
							                                        This is a specialty massage and has a fixed price of $150. The added price accommodates for the detailed work I will perform, which requires more energy and strain on my own body. Please let me know if you have any questions about my prices.<br><br>
							                                        Bookings can be made up to 24 hours in advance and payment instructions will be sent via confirmation email.<br><br>

							                                        Many of us grind or clench our teeth at night, and we all hold a great deal of tension and emotion in our head and neck, especially in the jaws and occipitals. I will do detailed work on everything above your shoulders, bringing relief to your jaws, forehead, face, scalp, and neck.<br><br>
