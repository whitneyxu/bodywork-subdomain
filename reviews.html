									<blockquote>“Whitney was able to target the areas I carry tension in a way that no bodyworker has before. I felt heard in my consultation and Whitney was able to give care and focus to where I carry pain and I felt it lasting into the next day. They were very communicative throughout the session and checked in periodically regarding the amount of pressure used. They also let me know what muscle groups they were targeting in my abdomen which I appreciated because I had never experienced that before and I like being educated and aware of what's happening. But they did it with a balance where I was able to also deeply relax and nearly fall asleep.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I found Gentle Tiger through one of their flyers posted in the neighborhood. The location was close to my home and very convenient. Whitney welcomed me into their work space and provided a safe, comfortable and healing environment for body work. They asked the important questions to allow us to be in sync on what my body needed in terms of massage intensity and my personal comfort. I would say Whitney has 'healing hands' and the entire experience was deeply relaxing and restorative.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Whitney has such an intuitive touch that made my body feel more entirely connected than when I arrived. Pressure was firm and grounded and their communication about pressure was perfect. Although I didn’t need to ask for lighter or deeper pressure, I felt the space was welcoming to honest communication about what I needed as the recipient.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Whitney was very gentle & transparent about scheduling and I never felt pressured at any point. They are very easy to talk to and a really grounded and present listener. They create a very safe and welcoming space with their energy & presentness. I felt safe the entire session, as well as right after.”</blockquote>
									

									<blockquote>“Whitney was very communicative at all points. I felt very free to express feedback and preferences during the message, and felt that my requests were met. Whitney was also proactive in inviting feedback.”</blockquote>
