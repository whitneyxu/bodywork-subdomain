									<h2>What makes my massage special?</h2>
									<p> <span class="image right" style="max-width: 60%;"><img src="images/whitney-massaging-gentle-tiger.jpg" alt="" /></span>Unlike other bodywork centers or spas, which perform a pre-planned bodywork sequence that stays the same for each client, I provide a custom designed massage for each and every session. I take extra care to really focus on areas of tension and pain.If you want only neck and shoulder work, I can do that. If for your next session, you only want work on your hips and legs, I am also very happy to do that.  I also incorporate some energy work into each session, which strengthens the effects of the bodywork. Your time is valuable, and I always want to make sure you are getting effective work done.</p>



									<h2>Why sliding scale and where do I fall on the scale?</h2>
									<p><span class="image left" style="max-width: 30%;"><img src="images/flowers.jpg"  alt="" /></span>I price my massages based on roughly half the price of other massages in the Bay Area. For example, a 60 minute massage elsewhere can cost up to $140, and I charge $70 as my lowest sliding scale tier. I do this to ensure that my work is more accessible to those who are lower income. I ask that you pay an amount that is a “stretch” but not a hardship. If you can afford to pay the highest tier (or higher), I greatly appreciate your donation. It allows me to continue to provide affordable bodywork for our community. You can always reach out to me if you’re unsure of where you fall on the sliding scale. I will never ask you to prove your income, and I will never refuse a client for paying below the sliding scale suggestion. You don’t have to pay the same amount each time if you’re a return client.

									<h2>Accessibility needs?</h2>
									<p>My home is not wheelchair accessible--there are 2 flights of stairs leading to the massage space.</p>

									<h2>How does payment work?</h2>
									<p>I accept card, cash, and most forms of e-payment (Venmo, Zelle, and Cashapp).</p>

									<h2>What should I expect during a session?</h2>
									<p>Your massage will be done at my home, where I reside with my partner. During our session, we will have complete privacy. You may hear some signs of life from other rooms, but no one will ever enter the room in which we are working together.</br></br>

									When you arrive, I will greet you at the door and we will spend 5-10 minutes settling into the space and speaking about the session. I usually burn some palo santo in between clients to cleanse the space energetically. I will always email or text you beforehand to make sure it is OK to burn the palo santo, in case you have sensitivities. There will be hot herbal tea available, and soft instrumental music playing. </br></br>

									After we have agreed on a plan for the session, I will ask you to dress down to your comfort level and position yourself on the table. The table warmer will be on, and you can let me know if you need it to be warmer or cooler. If you choose to remove your clothing, I will work on you with organic jojoba oil, or lotion if you prefer. With your permission, I may also use an organic coconut and shea butter CBD cream on areas needing extra relief.  If you choose to leave your clothes on, I ask that you wear something made of soft natural fibers such as cotton. </br></br>

									When there are 10 minutes remaining in our session, I will check in to see if there are any areas that are calling for attention before we end. Afterwards, you may relax on the table for as long as you would like. We will then reconvene and speak briefly about the session before I walk you to the door. I will take payment at the end of each session.
